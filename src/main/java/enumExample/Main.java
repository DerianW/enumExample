        Enums are like classes. They have fields/properties and they can have methods.
        Enums are implicitly static and final.

        All properties of enums are implicitly public, static, and final.
        We write their names with capital letters.

        Properties must be declared before anything else. They are separated by commas.

        We use enums because they can be easier to read and it makes it easier for the compiler to catch errors.
        We use enums when we need to represent a fixed set of constants.

        Enums can have constructors for their fields.

        All enums have a method called .values() and .toString(), but the toString typically gets overridden.
